# Transport-project-using-excel
This project presents an interactive **Road Accident Analysis** Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize road accident casualty data.
The dashboard provides a high-level summary of total casualties and breaks them down by **severity (fatal, serious, slight), vehicle type,
road type, road surface condition, location (urban vs rural), and time (monthly and yearly trends)**.

The analysis enables quick identification of high-risk areas, accident-prone road conditions, and patterns across different years and months.
By consolidating key metrics and visual insights into a single dashboard, the project supports **data-driven decision-making** for understanding accident trends
and improving road safety strategies.
