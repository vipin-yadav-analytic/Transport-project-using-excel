# Transport-project-using-excel
This project presents an interactive **Road Accident Analysis** Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize road accident casualty data.
The dashboard provides a high-level summary of total casualties and breaks them down by **severity (fatal, serious, slight), vehicle type,
road type, road surface condition, location (urban vs rural), and time (monthly and yearly trends)**.

The analysis enables quick identification of high-risk areas, accident-prone road conditions, and patterns across different years and months.
By consolidating key metrics and visual insights into a single dashboard, the project supports **data-driven decision-making** for understanding accident trends
and improving road safety strategies.

This project solves a real transport problem by analyzing road accident data to identify high-risk roads, vehicle types, and time periods.
The insights can help authorities improve road safety, reduce casualties, and make data-driven transport decisions.

## Key Insights

**Slight casualties account for the majority of total casualties**, indicating that while most accidents are non-fatal, they still contribute significantly to overall injuries and healthcare burden.

**Cars are involved in the highest number of casualties**, making them the most critical vehicle category to target for safety interventions.
Single carriageway roads record the highest number of casualties, suggesting that road design and traffic flow
on these roads may pose higher accident risks.

**Dry road conditions still account for the majority of accident**s, indicating that accidents are more strongly influenced by traffic volume and driver behavior than adverse weather alone.

**Urban areas report more casualties than rural areas**, likely due to higher traffic density and congestion in urban regions.
Daylight conditions show significantly higher casualties compared to darkness, suggesting increased traffic movement during daytime hours leads to more accidents.
