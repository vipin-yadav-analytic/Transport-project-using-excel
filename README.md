# Transport-project-using-excel
This project presents an interactive **Road Accident Analysis** Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize road accident casualty data.
The dashboard provides a high-level summary of total casualties and breaks them down by **severity (fatal, serious, slight), vehicle type,
road type, road surface condition, location (urban vs rural), and time (monthly and yearly trends)**.
The analysis enables quick identification of high-risk areas, accident-prone road conditions, and patterns across different years and months.
By consolidating key metrics and visual insights into a single dashboard, the project supports **data-driven decision-making** for understanding accident trends
and improving road safety strategies.

This project solves a real transport problem by analyzing road accident data to identify high-risk roads, vehicle types, and time periods.
The insights can help authorities improve road safety, reduce casualties, and make data-driven transport decisions.
